    <h3>Target Audience: </h3>
    <p>Siena College Students</p>
    <h3>Problems: No official roommate matching system in Siena College.</h3>
    <p>For class, we had to choose a minority population to create, design, and research an app or website 
        for. We chose the low income population as growing up in Queens, NY, I resonated with this community
        and witnessed the problems firsthand. Of the many struggles this population faces, I chose food 
        insecurity as it affects millions of people: even in places where food waste is common. Every 
        day, restaurants, grocery stores, and other businesses throw away large amounts of edible food, 
        while nearby individuals and families go without nutritious meals. This stark imbalance reveals 
        a deeper issueâ€”not a lack of food, but a failure in distribution. </p>
    <p>During times of crisis, such as economic downturns or public health emergencies, the impact 
        of food insecurity becomes even more severe. Vulnerable populations face greater challenges, 
        from reduced income to limited access to support services. In these moments, the strength and 
        connectedness of a community become especially important. </p>
