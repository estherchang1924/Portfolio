    <h3>Target Audience: </h3>
    <p>Low income population</p>
    <h3>Problems: Food Insecurity among the low income population.</h3>
    <p>For class, we had to choose a minority population to create, design, and research an app or website 
        for. We chose the low income population as growing up in Queens, NY, I resonated with this community
        and witnessed the problems firsthand. Of the many struggles this population faces, I chose food 
        insecurity as it affects millions of people: even in places where food waste is common. Every 
        day, restaurants, grocery stores, and other businesses throw away large amounts of edible food, 
        while nearby individuals and families go without nutritious meals. This stark imbalance reveals 
        a deeper issue—not a lack of food, but a failure in distribution. </p>
    <p>During times of crisis, such as economic downturns or public health emergencies, the impact 
        of food insecurity becomes even more severe. Vulnerable populations face greater challenges, 
        from reduced income to limited access to support services. In these moments, the strength and 
        connectedness of a community become especially important. </p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>The platform is designed to reduce food waste and fight food insecurity by connecting restaurants
        and food businesses with individuals in need. It enables the donation or discounted sale of 
        leftover meals, making surplus food accessible to low-income community members. With a simple 
        interface and location-based features, users can quickly find nearby food offerings or share 
        excess meals with others. By encouraging collaboration between businesses and the community, 
        the platform strengthens local support networks and ensures good food doesn't go to waste. </p>
    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <p>To understand the needs and preferances that the app would require for our target population, I 
        conducted user research. Qualitative, moderated, in-person testing would be the best for my project.
        Since I’m aiming to understand user behavior, identify pain points in their experiences when using
        our app/website, and improve the overall user experience, observing participants as they interact 
        with the product while asking questions will offer the most valuable insights for the project. 
        Qualitative data will help uncover specific problems users face and why they occur, which is 
        especially helpful during the mid-stage of the project, where there’s still flexibility to make design
         changes unlike at the end stages where it’s difficult to make great design changes. A moderated 
         approach also helps me gather deeper context and clarify participant responses. </p>
